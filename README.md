# Solar_System_Graphic_Representation
 html page that represents the Solar System. 

 This program includes multiple interactions: 
 - Slider to control amount of stars
 - Slider to control planets movement speed
 - Button to switch between Daytime/Nighttime on planet Earth
 - Button for realistic mode:
    - Planets get a realistic size ?
    - Planets get a closer to realistic speed
    - No rings
    - Planets get a realistic distance between each other



Features to add: 
- option for realistic version
    - botton to remove rings
    - realistic movement speed
    - realistic distances (in progress)



Optimizations: 
- stop rotation of saturn ring
- add a yearly counter 
- add a sphere as a background and set it as milky way
    - add a botton to disable it
- in non realistic mode make sun a little smaller so it everything fits a lil better

Fixes: 
- fix "NoRings" botton
- fix uranus imagine (replace it)
- fix moon rotation (has to be oppisite direction)
- create slider to control number of stars (optional) (in progress) <-- needs to be refined
- add ambiance light (in progress)
- add light from the sun (in progress)
